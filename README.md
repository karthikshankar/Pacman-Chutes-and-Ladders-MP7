# Pacman-Chutes-and-Ladders-MP7

 This game is a combination of the once popular board game Chutes and Ladders and of the popular arcade game Pacman. It takes place on a Pacman style game board, but contains chutes and ladders. Pacman is randomly generated on the bottom left corner of the game, while the monsters are randomly generated on the first row. Pacman has access to the chutes and ladders, while the monsters do not, but they move anywhere from 1-10 steps in front of them, while Pacman can only move form 1-6 steps ahead. During the game, if Pacman lands at the bottom of a ladder, he is able to move all the way up the ladder and if he lands at the top of a chute, he must move down the chute. The goal of the game is, with the help of chutes and ladders to reach the top right of the game before the monsters do - and in the fastest time possible!
